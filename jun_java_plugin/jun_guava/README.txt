This is a pet project demonstrating some of the basic usage in the Google Guava library:

> http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/

The best way to try them out for yourself is to: 
 1) Clone the project
 2) Run mvn eclipse:eclipse
 3) Import into Eclipse
 4) Explore and run the different test-classes in src/test/java.

You can also find slides with the examples here: http://blog.tfnico.com/2010/06/google-guava-taking-over-for-google.html
